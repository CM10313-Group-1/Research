- **Produce a smartphone app to make the recording method accessible.**
- **Prompt users to record data with notifications if they have forgotten to.**
- Avoid attempts to collect extremely accurate data; some relatively inaccurate is better than none at all.
- Provide the ability to generate multiple visualisations within the application.
- Generate one default "main view" of the data for quick reflection.
- Provide the ability to inspect all data across time, without limits.
- Do not necessarily bubble up data that is too old to avoid self-criticism.
- Possibly allow users to define their own data series to collect?
- Allow users to import data from spreadsheets.
- Allow users to export data in CSV.
- Allow collection of multiple different kinds of data.
- Automate as much of data collection as possible.
- Make recording data as simple as possible - (i.e. measure number of navigations to meaningful entry).
- Allow users to set more than one goal (per data category?)
- If rewards are necessary make their acquisition surprising.
