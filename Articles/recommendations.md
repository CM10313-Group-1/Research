# Recommendations

This file contains a list of all recommendations derived from the article research team.

- Recommended data categories
  - Exercise
  - Finance
  - Journaling
  - General health (sleep, diet, etc)
- **Produce a smartphone app to make the recording method accessible.**
- **Prompt users to record data with notifications if they have forgotten to.**
- Avoid attempts to collect extremely accurate data; some relatively inaccurate is better than none at all.
- Provide the ability to generate multiple visualisations within the application.
- Generate one default "main view" of the data for quick reflection.
- Provide the ability to inspect all data across time, without limits.
- Do not necessarily bubble up data that is too old to avoid self-criticism.
- Possibly allow users to define their own data series to collect?
- Allow users to import data from spreadsheets.
- Allow users to export data in CSV.
- Allow collection of multiple different kinds of data.
- Automate as much of data collection as possible.
- Make recording data as simple as possible - (i.e. measure number of navigations to meaningful entry).
- Allow users to set more than one goal (per data category?)
- If rewards are necessary make their acquisition surprising.
- Consider conceptual designs which shift the focus of behaviour change to a joint human-system effort 
- Acknowledge user of system's capabilities
- Provide insight into the autonomous behaviour of the system
- Decide on the kind of relationship (cooperative, augmented, ambient) the system will have with the user and how/will this vary over the course of use
- Gather feedback for the use of system and system interjections (such as reminders)
- Explore forms of real-time system-provided feedback to decrease the need for sophisticated post hoc data analysis by the user
- Do not just present data readings, provide understanding 
- Present different data together so that user can made correlations better
- Include recommendations for improvement having considered personal information such age, gender, sleep disorders
- Recommendations should be a combination of numerical data and text instructions
